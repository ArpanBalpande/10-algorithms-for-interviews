## Why Practicing Algorithms Is Key?
If you are relatively new to Python and plan to start interviewing for top companies (among which FAANG) listen to this: you need to start practicing algorithms right now.

Don’t be naive like I was when I first started solving them. Despite I thought that cracking a couple of algorithms every now and then was fun, I never spent too much time to practice and even less time to implement a faster or more efficient solution. Between myself, I was thinking that at the end of the day solving algorithms all day long was a bit too nerdy, it didn’t really have a practical use in the real daily work environment and it would not have brought much to my pocket in the longer term.

> “Knowing how to solve algorithms will give you a competitive advantage during the job search process”

Well…I was wrong (at least partially): I still think that spending too much time on algorithms without focusing on other skills is not enough to make you land your dream job, but I understood that since complex problems present themselves in every day work as a programmer, big companies had to find a standardized process to gather insights on the candidate’s problem solving and attention to detail skills. This means that knowing how to solve algorithms will give you a competitive advantage during the job search process as even less famous companies tend to adopt similar evaluation methods.

## There Is An Entire World Out There
Pretty soon after I started solving algorithms more consistently, I found out that there are plenty of resources out there to practice, learn the most efficient strategies to solve them and get mentally ready for interviews (HackerRank, LeetCode, CodingBat and GeeksForGeeks are just few examples).

Together with practicing the top interview questions, these websites often group algorithms by company, embed active blogs where people share detailed summaries of their interview experience and sometimes even offer mock interview questions as part of premium plans.

For example, LeetCode let you filter top interview questions by specific companies and by frequency. You can also choose the level of difficulty (Easy, Medium and Hard) you feel comfortable with:

There are hundreds of different algorithmic problems out there, meaning that being able to recognize the common patterns and code an efficient solution in less then 10 mins will require a lot of time and dedication.

Don’t be disappointed if you really struggle to solve them at first, this is completely normal. Even more experienced Python programmers would find many algorithms challenging to solve in a short time without an adequate training.

Also don’t be disappointed if your interview doesn’t go as you expected and you just started solving algorithms. There are people that prepare for months solving a few problems every day and rehearse them regularly before they are able to nail an interview.

To help you in your training process, below I have selected 10 algorithms (mainly around String Manipulation and Arrays) that I have seen appearing again and again in phone coding interviews. The level of these problems is mainly easy so consider them as good starting point.

Please note that the solution I shared for each problem is just one of the many potential solutions that could be implemented and often a BF (“Brute Force”) one. Therefore feel free to code your own version of the algorithm, trying to find the right balance between runtime and employed memory.
